brief: Efficent way to route (OSC) messages and numbers to different outlets

desc: >
 jcom.pass routes entire (OSC) messages to dedicated outlets and optionally strips away the leading slash. It is faster than jcom.oscroute, because jcom.pass does not parse and process the osc string further. In contrast to @route@, jcom.pass does not delete the message name.

inputs:
  - name: 1
    desc: Incoming (OSC) messages

outputs:
 - name: Nth
   desc: Output message routed through the Nth argument
 - name: right
   desc: dumpout / overflow from non-matching inputs

args:
 - name: name
   type: symbol
   optional: 1
   desc: name of the message routed to the Nth outlet

attributes:
 - name: strip
   type: boolean
   desc: Strip any leading slashes from the messages.
   default: 1
 - name: stripnonmatches
   type: boolean
   desc: Strip any leading slashes from the messages at the overflow outlet.
   default: 0	

messages:
 - name: OSC-message
   type: string
   desc: Any OSC message
 - name: anything
   type: any
   desc: any list, if it does not match any argument, it will be send to the rightmost outlet
